One Sentence at a Time

React Native app to process DRM-FREE .epub files and display them to the user one sentence at a time, requiring user taps to scroll back/forwards through the pages.

Intended as a reading aid for people with ADHD or other neurodivergent people, but may be useful for anyone interested.
